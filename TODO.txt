* DONE make the selector work. at each event it should redraw the currently selected image without the white border. (Jonathan R might need help my logic seems wrong somehere and cant find out where)
* DONE make the event work with the ISOs and make sure it knows how to look for the game images (patrick will do this one)
* DONE put the isos in a directory on the dolphinbox
* DONE organize the formatting in the event loop to make it look neater (Jonathan R)
* DONE fix up memory management (i.e. close pointers and stuff, maybe unload everything while the emulator is running)

* DONE implement advancer methods. these take an int, -1 for moving left, 0 for not moving, 1 for right. 2 for up, -2 for down (patrick)
* DONE implement executeDolphin() which takes the current selection and either starts the emulator or draws the appropriate screen. (patrick)
* DONE implement some initialization stuff and others as static methods, make the code look better, less cluttered.
