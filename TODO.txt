* TODO make 4 controller variables (or an array or something) and keep track of them so that the loader can use 4 contorllers just like the game (Jonathan R)
* TODO make the selector work. at each event it should redraw the currently selected image without the white border. (Jonathan R might need help my logic seems wrong somehere and cant find out where)
* TODO make the event work with the ISOs and make sure it knows how to look for the game images (patrick will do this one)
* TODO organize the formatting in the event loop to make it look neater (Jonathan R)
* TODO close the controller
* TODO fix up memory management (i.e. close pointers and stuff, maybe unload everything while the emulator is running)
* DONE fix the sonic heroes image (patrick will do this too)
* TODO implement advancer methods. these take an int, -1 for moving left, 0 for not moving, 1 for right. 2 for up, -2 for down (patrick)
* TODO implement the setToSetting() method which returns a string and draws the settings icon.
* TODO implement executeDolphin() which takes the current selection and either starts the emulator or draws the appropriate screen. (patrick)
* DONE #define for ADVANCE_LEFT, ADVANCE_RIGHT, ADVANCE_DOWN, ADVANCE_UP for the advancer methods and RIGHT_DEADZONE and LEFT_DEADZONE
* TODO implement some initialization stuff and others as static methods, make the code look better, less cluttered.
