TODO:
- make 4 controller variables (or an array or something) and keep track of them so that the loader can use 4 contorllers just like the game
- make the selector work. at each event it should redraw the currently selected image without the white border.
- make the event work with the ISOs and make sure it knows how to look for the game images (patrick will do this one)
- organize the formatting in the event loop to make it look neater
- close the controller
- fix up memory management (i.e. close pointers and stuff, maybe unload everything while the emulator is running)
- fix the sonic heroes image (patrick will do this too)
- if you guys think of anything else add it and let me know.
